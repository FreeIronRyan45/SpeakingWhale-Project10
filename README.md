Speaking Whale-Project 10 for Javascript Course On Codecademy Pro

In this project, I'm taking a phrase like ‘turpentine and turtles’ and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: ‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’.

There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:

There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.
The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so I must double them in our program.


Once I have converted text to the whale language, the result is sung slowly, as is a custom in the ocean. To accomplish this translation, I'll be using my knowledge of loops.
